URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)

EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr 3ohn Smith 13
Output: "Mr%203ohn%20Smith"
Hints: #53,0118

==========Solution1=========
Time Complexity: O(n) n is the length of s
Space Complexity: O(n)

StringBuilder sb
for(c in s)
    if c == " ":
        sb.append("%20")
    else:
        sb.append(c)
return sb.toString()

==========Solution2=========
Time Complexity: O(trueLength)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Given char[] s and int trueLength, perform this operation in-place


s =[a, , b, c, ,d       ]
trueLength = 6

spaceCount = 2
newLength =  trueLength + spaceCount * 2 = 10
i = trueLength - 1
j = newLength - 1
while(i < j){
    if(s[i] == " ")
        s[j] = "0"
        s[j - 1] = "2"
        s[j - 2] = "%"
        j -= 3
        i--
     else:
        swap(s, i, j)
        i--;
        j--
}
}

s = [a,% , 2, 0, b, c,% , 2, 0, b,      ]
     i
     j
