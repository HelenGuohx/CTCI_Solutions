Three in One: Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
Hints: #2, #12, #38, #58

#2. 3.1 A stack is simply a data structure in which the most recently added elements are
removed first. Can you simulate a single stack using an array? Remember that there are
many possible solutions, and there are tradeoffs of each.

=====Solution======
suppose stack stores integer elements
max_size = 100
size = 0

push(val){
if size == max_size
   double the max_size

array[size++] = val
}

pop(){
if size == 0
    return null

size--;
}

peek(){
if size == 0
    return null
return array[size - 1]
}


#12, 3.1 We could simulate three stacks in an array by just allocating the first third of the array to
the first stack, the second third to the second stack, and the final third to the third stack.
One might actually be much bigger than the others, though. Can we be more flexible
with the divisions?

#38. 3.1 If you want to allow for flexible divisions, you can shift stacks around. Can you ensure
that all available capacity is used?


#58. 3.1 Try thinking about the array as circular, such that the end of the array "wraps around" to
the start of the array.
